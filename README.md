# Flood Fill & Paint

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the **flood fill** (**Depth First Search algorithm**) in Python, with Graphics User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

The flood fill algorithm is used in the "paint bucket" tool in graphics programs, and it is a simple algorithm that fills an area within a border. 

The user can select a color to paint, and click or drag the mouse on the canvas to start painting. For filling an area, they need to choose the color to fill and click on the area to be filled.
